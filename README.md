A simple and interactive web app to explore Lok Sabha election results from 1952 to 2024. This tool is designed to make election data easy to understand for everyone — whether you're a student, researcher, journalist, or just someone curious about India’s political history.
With this application, users can quickly search constituency-wise results, discover how different parties performed in each election year, and explore long-term political trends in a clear and visual way.
It also includes powerful tools to track a party’s performance across decades and compare multiple political parties side-by-side, making it easier to analyze shifts in vote share, dominance, and electoral patterns over time.
The goal of this project is to bring scattered election data into one clean, simple, and user-friendly interface so that anyone can explore India’s electoral journey with just a few clicks.
